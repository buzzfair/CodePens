/*
Itâ€™s worth memorizing the entire example below. 
It represents a very common design pattern used 
to scale images and videos proportionally.

Note: The example scales the width of an image (or video) 
to the width of a container. 

If the image is larger than the container, 
the vertical portion of the image will overflow 
and will not display. 

To swap this behavior, you can set max-height 
to 100% and width to auto (essentially swapping the values).

This will scale the height of the media with 
the height of the container instead. 

If the media is larger than the container, the 
horizontal portion of the image will overflow 
and will not display.

.container {
  width: 50%;
  height: 200px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.container img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  display: block;
